## Simulation Description

The GIF demonstrates the simulation of cross-flow management at an intersection where two orthogonal lanes intersect at the origin, forming a constrained space. A **green circle** with a radius of 90 meters represents the **control region** managed by a centralized system. As agents enter this region, their acceleration and movement are actively managed to ensure efficient and collision-free crossings at the intersection.

This simulation aligns with the study's focus on the **"early versus late management"** approach to managing autonomous agents in constrained spaces. **Early management** involves proactive control of agents using larger control regions before they reach critical areas, while **late management** intervenes closer to the intersection with smaller control regions.

The research investigates how intervention timing affects operational constraints, aiming to determine the optimal strategy for cross-flow management. The simulation supports the hypothesis that **increasing the control region radius beyond a certain threshold leads to diminishing returns** in system performance. This emphasizes the need to find the **optimal control region size** for maximizing efficiency and safety.

## About

This repository contains the official implementation of the simulation framework used in the paper:

> **Early Intervention Strategies to Enhance Fairness and Efficiency in Autonomous Traffic Flow Management**  
> Submitted to **IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)**.  
> Authors: *Salman Ghori*, *Ania Adil*, *Melkior Ornik*, *Eric Feron*.

The code implements a **receding-horizon MILP controller** for agents approaching a two-flow orthogonal intersection inside a **circular control zone**. The simulator supports different control zone radii, fairness constraints, and Poisson-based arrival processes to evaluate delay, fairness, and efficiency metrics.
