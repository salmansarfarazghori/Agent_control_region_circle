## Simulation Description

The GIF demonstrates the simulation of cross-flow management at an intersection where two orthogonal lanes intersect at the origin, forming a constrained space. A **green circle** with a radius of 90 meters represents the **control region** managed by a centralized system. As agents enter this region, their acceleration and movement are actively managed to ensure efficient and collision-free crossings at the intersection.

This simulation aligns with the study's focus on the **"early versus late management"** approach to managing autonomous agents in constrained spaces. **Early management** involves proactive control of agents using larger control regions before they reach critical areas, while **late management** intervenes closer to the intersection with smaller control regions.

The research investigates how intervention timing affects operational constraints, aiming to determine the optimal strategy for cross-flow management. The simulation supports the hypothesis that **increasing the control region radius beyond a certain threshold leads to diminishing returns** in system performance. This emphasizes the need to find the **optimal control region size** for maximizing efficiency and safety.
